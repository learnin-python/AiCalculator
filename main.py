"""
a basic example of an artificially intelligent calculator, or an AI calculator.
This is how the application works:

    It takes in inputs as text
    Translates them into mathematical notation
    Returns the answers in the numerical form

Use the following keywords for their associated operations:

    plus for addition
    minus for subtraction
    times for multiplication
    divided by for division
